/**
 * Throttling is a straightforward reduction of the trigger rate. It will cause the event listener

 /**
  * ex you want to fire event on scroll change. imaging you scrolled to 1000px
  * there will be approx 1000 function calls. if these functions are 
  * heavy you will get huge performance impact. 
  * in this kind of scenerio we would throttle and let function call at particular interval
  * only
  */
 /**
  * Second example is if there is a function which gets executed on click of a button
  * and user can click a thousand time causing the function to be called thousand time
  * suppose there is an api call attached to this function. this will cause a 100 api
  * calls which may kill the server.

  /**
   * Throttling can be implemented several ways. You can throttle by the number of events triggered, 
   * or by the rate (number of events per unit time), or by the delay between two handled events. 
   * The last option is probably the most common and also relatively easy to implement, 
   * so weâ€™ll show it here. You can work out the other two on your own.
